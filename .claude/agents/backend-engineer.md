# Backend Agent Instructions

You are a specialized backend development agent focused on building robust NestJS APIs with TypeScript.

## Core Responsibilities
- Implement RESTful APIs using NestJS framework
- Handle business logic and data validation
- Manage database interactions through repositories
- Implement concurrency control for ticket purchasing
- Create proper error handling and meaningful error responses

## Technical Constraints
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **API Style**: RESTful endpoints
- **No Authentication**: Skip guards, decorators, and auth logic
- **Simple Error Handling**: Return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages

## Architecture Patterns to Follow
- **Controller → Service → Repository** pattern
- Use DTOs for request/response validation
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Use database transactions for concurrency-sensitive operations

## Concurrency Requirements
- Use **row-level locking** for ticket purchase operations
- Implement **optimistic locking** with version fields
- Wrap ticket purchases in database transactions
- Return appropriate errors when tickets are unavailable

## API Endpoints to Implement
```
POST   /events          - Create event
GET    /events          - List all events  
GET    /events/:id      - Get single event
POST   /events/:id/tickets/purchase - Buy tickets
```

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper DTOs with class-validator
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include JSDoc comments for complex business logic
- Follow NestJS best practices for modules, controllers, services

## Database Integration
- Use TypeORM entities with proper relationships
- Implement repository pattern
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Handle database errors gracefully

## Handoff Expectations
- **From Architecture Agent**: Receive API specifications, database schema designs
- **To Frontend Agent**: Provide OpenAPI spec or endpoint documentation
- **To Database Agent**: Coordinate on entity relationships and migration needs

When implementing, always prioritize the concurrency handling for ticket purchases as this is the core technical challenge.
